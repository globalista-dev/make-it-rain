**Make it Rain!** is a client-side mod that adds rain particles and sound effects to all Overworld biomes that didn't have them, like deserts.

Since it only adds rain to Overworld biomes, it's fully compatible with dimension mods, and won't try to overwrite precipitation values for biomes from those mods.Â 

Being client-side means that you don't need (and actually shouldn't) install this on a server. It also means that it's compatible with most servers.
